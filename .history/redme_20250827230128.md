1. What is the difference between getElementById, getElementsByClassName, and querySelector / querySelectorAll?

Ans : getElementById → Its function is to select a specific element by its ID, so we can perform tasks using that unique ID.
getElementsByClassName → This is used to select multiple elements that share the same class name, allowing us to work with all of them together.
querySelector → If there are multiple class names or tag names, it selects only the first one and lets us work with it.
querySelectorAll → This is used to select all elements with the same tag name or class name, so we can perform tasks on all of them at once.

2. How do you create and insert a new element into the DOM?

Ans : To create a new element, we use two methods.
First, we create the element with document.createElement() this can create any element we want.
Then, to add that element to the page, we use appendChild().

3. What is Event Bubbling and how does it work?

Ans : When an event occurs on an element, the event first works on the target element itself and then slowly propagates upward through its parent elements in the DOM tree. This process is called event bubbling.

4. 
Event Delegation is a JavaScript technique where the event listener on a parent element is used to handle the events of its child elements, instead of attaching separate listeners to each child element.

5. The job of preventDefault() is to stop the default behavior of an event, while the job of stopPropagation() is to stop event bubbling.
