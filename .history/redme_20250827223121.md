1. What is the difference between getElementById, getElementsByClassName, and querySelector / querySelectorAll?

Ans : getElementById → Its function is to select a specific element by its ID, so we can perform tasks using that unique ID.
getElementsByClassName → This is used to select multiple elements that share the same class name, allowing us to work with all of them together.
querySelector → If there are multiple class names or tag names, it selects only the first one and lets us work with it.
querySelectorAll → This is used to select all elements with the same tag name or class name, so we can perform tasks on all of them at once.
